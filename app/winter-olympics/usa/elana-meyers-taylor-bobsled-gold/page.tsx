          <strong>CORTINA D&apos;AMPEZZO, ITALY</strong> — At an age when most elite athletes have long retired, Elana Meyers Taylor was just getting started. The 41-year-old American bobsled legend won gold in the women&apos;s monobob at the <Link href="/winter-olympics" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics</Link> on Monday, becoming the oldest Olympic bobsled champion in the history of the sport — and cementing her place as the most decorated female bobsledder to ever compete at the Games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meyers Taylor&apos;s four-run total gave her a commanding victory over Germany&apos;s Laura Nolte (silver) and Canada&apos;s Christine de Bruin (bronze), and the moment the results were confirmed, she broke down in tears on the ice of the Cortina sliding track. It was the culmination of a career spanning five Olympic cycles, two continents, and more setbacks than most athletes could endure.
        </p>

        <h2>A Masterclass in the Cortina Ice</h2>
        <p>
          From the very first training run, it was clear Meyers Taylor was in a different class. Her piloting through the demanding Cortina track — 16 curves, 1,408 meters long — was precise, aggressive, and elegant at once. She posted the fastest time in three of the four competitive heats, and her third-run clocking shattered the existing track record.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her technique illustrated exactly why she remains a world-class competitor at 41: superior entrance angles into the corners, perfect weight distribution through the transition zones, and an uncanny ability to find speed on the straightaways where fractions of a second compound across the run. Competitors from Germany, Canada, and Switzerland — all significantly younger — could not keep pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;I&apos;ve been studying this track for two years,&quot; Meyers Taylor said after her final run. &quot;Every curve. Every push start variation. I came here knowing every inch of it, and today it all came together.&quot;
        </p>

        <h2>The Most Decorated Female Bobsledder in History</h2>
        <p>
          This gold medal is Meyers Taylor&apos;s fourth Olympic medal spreading across four consecutive Games:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sochi 2014</strong> — Silver (two-woman bobsled)</li>
          <li><strong>PyeongChang 2018</strong> — Bronze (two-woman bobsled)</li>
          <li><strong>Beijing 2022</strong> — Silver (women&apos;s monobob)</li>
          <li><strong>Milano Cortina 2026</strong> — Gold (women&apos;s monobob) ✅</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No female bobsled athlete in history has won four Olympic medals. Her Beijing silver, just four years ago, had seemed like a potential final act in a legendary career. Instead, Meyers Taylor used it as motivation, retooled her training program, and returned to the circuit with renewed purpose. The gold she earned on Monday is a result of what her coaches describe as the most focused four-year training block of her career.
        </p>

        <h2>Oldest Champion in Olympic Bobsled History</h2>
        <p>
          At 41 years and 3 months, Meyers Taylor surpasses Swiss pilot Beat Hefti — who won four-man bobsled gold at age 38 during Sochi 2014 — as the oldest Olympic bobsled champion ever. She is also believed to be the oldest American woman to win Winter Olympic gold in any discipline since 1952.
        </p>
        <p>
          The achievement sits in remarkable company. Only a handful of athletes across all Winter Olympic sports have won gold after 40, and most in events where experience (such as curling or biathlon) provides a more direct advantage. Bobsled is an explosively physical discipline — raw power in the push-start, split-second decisions through curves traveling over 100 km/h. Age is not supposed to be an asset. Meyers Taylor has made it one.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;People kept asking me if this would be my last Games,&quot; she said. &quot;I kept saying: I&apos;ll stop when the times say stop. They haven&apos;t said stop yet.&quot;
        </p>

        <h2>A Personal Journey That Defines the Achievement</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond the records, Meyers Taylor&apos;s Milan gold carries deep personal weight. She competed at Beijing 2022 while pregnant, won silver, and continued competing through one of the most physically demanding transitions an athlete can make. Her son traveled with her to Italy for these Games — making the victory a full-circle moment she described as &quot;more than I could have written.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          She has also been an outspoken advocate for diversity in winter sports, becoming one of the most recognizable Black athletes in the history of winter competition — a community historically underrepresented at the Games. Her visibility on the world stage, across five Olympics, has helped transform the global face of bobsled.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;I want kids who look like me to see this and know the door is open,&quot; she said on the podium. &quot;This sport is for everyone. These Games are for everyone.&quot;
        </p>

        <h2>Team USA&apos;s Moment at Milano Cortina 2026</h2>
        <p>
          The Meyers Taylor victory adds a marquee gold to a strong overall performance from <Link href="/winter-olympics/usa" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Team USA</Link> at Milano Cortina 2026. The United States entered Day 11 sitting third in the overall medal standings with approximately 19 total medals and 6 gold medals. The bobsled gold is widely considered one of the most emotionally resonant American victories of these Games — a fitting capstone for a career that has lasted longer and shone brighter than anyone anticipated.
        </p>
        <p>
          For context, when Meyers Taylor first competed at an Olympics in 2010 in Vancouver, today&apos;s youngest competitors were still in elementary school. She has outlasted generations of rivals, adapted across equipment rule changes, overcome injuries, and balanced elite sport with motherhood — all while keeping her times competitive at the very highest level.
        </p>

        <h2>What Comes Next</h2>
        <p>
          The obvious question now is whether Meyers Taylor will continue toward LA 2028 — a Summer Games, not Winter — and whether she has any intention of returning for the 2030 Winter Olympics in France. She was diplomatic in her answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Right now? Right now I just want to hold this medal and cry some more,&quot; she laughed. &quot;I&apos;ll figure out tomorrow — tomorrow.&quot;
        </p>
