        <p>
          Researchers at the <strong>University of British Columbia (UBC)</strong>, in collaboration with the{' '}
          <strong>Berlin Institute of Health at Charité</strong> in Germany, have developed the first CRISPR-based
          gene-editing therapy delivered topically to human skin. The treatment corrects disease-causing mutations
          directly in skin tissue and was detailed in a study published on{' '}
          <strong>January 27, 2026</strong>, in{' '}
          <a
            href="https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/abstract/S1934-5909(25)00466-8"

            <em>Cell Stem Cell</em>
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          The approach uses <strong>lipid nanoparticles</strong> to carry a CRISPR base editor through the skin
          surface, targeting stem cells in the epidermis to repair faulty genes. In laboratory-grown human skin models,
          the therapy restored up to <strong>30% of normal skin function</strong> in models of{' '}
          <strong>autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI)</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>The Breakthrough in Topical Delivery</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional gene therapies require invasive delivery methods such as injections or viral vectors. This study
          demonstrates that topical application — similar to a cream — achieves therapeutic gene correction without
          systemic exposure. Lipid nanoparticles penetrate the skin barrier and deliver an engineered cytosine base
          editor (<strong>eTd-CBE</strong>), which precisely changes a single DNA base to correct the most common
          mutation in ARCI without cutting both DNA strands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The editing remained <strong>localized to the skin</strong> with no detectable off-target effects in the
          tested models. On-target editing reached up to <strong>26% in patient-derived keratinocytes</strong>, with
          no bystander edits observed — one of the first demonstrations of therapeutic splice-site repair using a
          cytosine base editor.
        </p>
        <p>
          This represents a significant technical advance. Previous gene-editing therapies for skin conditions relied
          on <em>ex vivo</em> editing — removing cells, correcting them in a lab dish, and reintroducing them — or on
          systemic delivery that exposes the entire body to the editing machinery. Delivering the correction directly
          through the skin surface simplifies administration and confines the intervention to the target tissue.
        </p>

        <h2>Targeted Disease: Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis (ARCI)</h2>
        <p>
          The proof-of-concept focused on{' '}
          <strong>ARCI</strong>, a rare inherited disorder that causes severe dry, scaling skin due to mutations in
          genes responsible for skin barrier function. The therapy corrected the most frequent mutation, restoring
          enzyme activity and skin barrier integrity in{' '}
          <strong>human skin-on-a-chip models</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          ARCI affects a small patient population globally. The condition currently has no cure, and management is
          limited to emollients, keratolytics, and systemic retinoids — none of which address the underlying genetic
          defect. Topical gene correction, if translated to patients, would change that calculus entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The research team noted that while ARCI was the initial target, the platform shows potential for adaptation
          to other genetic skin disorders, including{' '}
          <strong>epidermolysis bullosa (EB)</strong>, and possibly more common inflammatory conditions such as{' '}
          <strong>eczema and psoriasis</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Technical Specifications</h2>
        <p>The delivery system includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Lipid nanoparticles</strong> optimized for skin penetration, bypassing the epidermal barrier
            without irritation or systemic leakage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CRISPR base editor (eTd-CBE)</strong> targeting the specific cytosine-to-thymine mutation most
            common in ARCI — no double-strand DNA breaks required.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No viral vectors</strong>, significantly reducing immunogenicity risks and simplifying regulatory
            pathways.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>One-time application potential</strong> — because epidermal stem cells are corrected, the
            therapeutic effect may be durable as corrected cells repopulate the skin surface.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The absence of viral delivery is particularly important. Viral vectors, while effective at gene delivery,
          carry risks of immune responses and have historically complicated the clinical development of gene therapies.
          A lipid nanoparticle formulation is already widely accepted clinically — the same class of delivery system
          used in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines — though skin penetration at therapeutic doses remains an active area of
          development.

        <p>
          The team combined expertise in CRISPR base editing, lipid nanoparticle formulation, dermatology, and skin
          stem cell biology — a multidisciplinary approach that enabled both the scientific advance and the
          translational roadmap toward clinical trials.
        </p>

        <h2>Path to Clinical Trials: Epithelica</h2>
        <p>
          The research team has spun out a startup called{' '}
          <strong>Epithelica</strong> to advance the technology toward clinical trials. The company is built around
          the topical gene-editing platform and is working to develop it as a commercial therapeutic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussions with regulatory authorities are underway to define the pathway for first-in-human studies. The
          approach is described as safe, scalable, and easy to use, with potential for broader application across the
          spectrum of dermatological gene editing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rare disease designations — such as Orphan Drug status in the U.S. and EU — could accelerate the regulatory
          path for an ARCI indication, given the small patient population and lack of curative options.
        </p>

        <h2>Broader Implications for Genetic Skin Diseases</h2>
        <p>
          This marks the <strong>first demonstration of topical CRISPR delivery achieving functional gene correction
          in human skin models</strong>. The localized nature minimizes off-target risks and simplifies administration
          compared to injections or viral methods — advantages that matter both clinically and regulatorily.
        </p>
        <p>
          If translated to patients, the platform could address both rare monogenic disorders and, through repeated or
          adjusted applications, potentially polygenic conditions. The skin-on-a-chip model used to demonstrate
          efficacy and safety is a validated preclinical platform, though animal studies and first-in-human trials
          remain ahead before clinical conclusions can be drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The broader field of in vivo gene editing at epithelial surfaces — skin, lung, gut — has gained momentum
          with lipid nanoparticle delivery. This study is among the most clinically compelling proofs of concept yet
          published, combining precision base editing with a non-invasive delivery route and a clear disease target.
        </p>
        <p>
          When CRISPR goes from injection to lotion bottle, the only thing left to edit might be the pharmacy shelf.
