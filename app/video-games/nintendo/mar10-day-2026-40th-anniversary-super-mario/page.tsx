        <h2>Nintendo MAR10 Day 2026: What Makes This Year the Biggest Celebration Yet</h2>
        <p>
          REDMOND, WA — Nintendo has officially launched its month-long celebration for MAR10 Day
          2026, and the stakes are higher than any previous installment. The company is
          simultaneously honoring the <strong>40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. (1985)</strong>{' '}
          and building toward the theatrical debut of{' '}
          <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> on April 1 — giving the entire month of
          March a dual purpose as both a nostalgia event and a cultural marketing campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nintendo&apos;s{' '}
          <a href="/video-games/nintendo">
            2026 strategy has been defined by its hardware and franchise momentum
          </a>
          , and MAR10 Day is the most concentrated expression of that strategy yet. From
          discounts on the Nintendo Switch 2 to the long-awaited return of Virtual Boy software,
          the festivities span hardware, software, streaming, merchandise, and theme parks.
        </p>

        <h2>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Release Date, Cast & Luma Update Explained</h2>
        <p>
          Animation is officially complete, and Nintendo and Illumination have shifted into full
          promotional drive for the sequel to the 2023 blockbuster{' '}
          <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>.
        </p>

        <HighlightBox color="blue">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Release Date:</strong> April 1, 2026 (North America)</li>
            <li><strong>New Cast — Brie Larson</strong> joins as <strong>Princess Rosalina</strong></li>
            <li><strong>New Cast — Benny Safdie</strong> voices <strong>Bowser Jr.</strong></li>
            <li>
              <strong>The &quot;Luma&quot; Update:</strong> A free update for{' '}
              <em>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 enhances visuals and
              performance ahead of the April 1 premiere
            </li>
          </ul>
        </HighlightBox>

        <p>
          The casting of Brie Larson as Rosalina is the headline addition, expanding the ensemble
          well beyond its original <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> lineup. Rosalina, the
          interstellar guardian of the Lumas, is a natural fit for a Galaxy-centered narrative —
          and one of the franchise&apos;s most distinctive characters outside of the core Mushroom
          Kingdom cast. Benny Safdie&apos;s Bowser Jr. signals a comedic subplot that will almost
          certainly be a focal point of trailers over the next three weeks.

        <h2>MAR10 Day Switch 2 Sale: First-Ever Discount on Nintendo&apos;s Flagship Hardware Title</h2>
        <p>
          In what Nintendo confirmed is a <strong>first-ever discount on a flagship Switch 2 title</strong>,
          the company is offering a limited-time sale on its newest party release through March 15.
        </p>

        <HighlightBox color="green">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Super Mario Party Jamboree – Switch 2 Edition:</strong> $59.99 (down from $69.99) at
              select retailers
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Classic Hits at $39.99:</strong> Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&apos;s
              Fury, and Super Mario Maker 2 — discounted on the eShop and at major retailers through March 15
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hardware Bonus:</strong> Participating retailers are offering a{' '}
              <strong>$180 store credit</strong> with the purchase of any Nintendo Switch 2 system bundled
              with a Mario title
            </li>
          </ul>
        </HighlightBox>

        <p>
          The $10 discount on Switch 2&apos;s party title may seem modest, but the symbolic signal is
          significant. Nintendo has maintained strict price discipline on its Switch 2 software
          since launch — a discount, even a small one, suggests the company is comfortable using
          MAR10 Day as a lever for hardware attach rate. The{' '}
          <a href="/video-games/switch2/pokemon-pokopia">
            Switch 2&apos;s software ecosystem continues to expand
          </a>
          , and bundling a $180 store credit with hardware is a meaningful incentive for
          households that have not yet made the upgrade.

        <h2>Virtual Boy Returns to Modern Hardware via Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack</h2>
        <p>
          Starting <strong>March 10</strong>, Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members
          will gain access to a library update that fans have been requesting for years: Virtual
          Boy titles playable on modern hardware for the first time.
        </p>

        <HighlightBox color="purple">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mario Clash</strong> — Virtual Boy (1995), now on Switch Online</li>
            <li><strong>Mario&apos;s Tennis</strong> — Virtual Boy (1995), now on Switch Online</li>
            <li>
              <strong>GBA Bonus:</strong> <em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</em> (GBA version) also joins the library
              on March 10
            </li>
          </ul>
        </HighlightBox>

        <p>
          The Virtual Boy additions are a genuine historical recovery. The console, which sold
          approximately 770,000 units before Nintendo discontinued it in 1996, has been a gap
          in the Switch Online library since the service launched. The two Mario titles are not
          system showcases — they are curiosities — but their arrival signals Nintendo&apos;s intent
          to eventually make its full console lineage accessible through the service. For context,
          Nintendo has also been{' '}
          <a href="/video-games/nintendo/google-project-genie-ai-knockoffs">
            monitoring the AI gaming landscape
          </a>{' '}
          closely as it expands its online infrastructure.

        <h2>Lunchables Golden Ticket, Super Nintendo World Sweepstakes & Talking Flower Toy</h2>
        <p>
          Nintendo has extended MAR10 Day well beyond digital storefronts with a set of
          real-world partnerships and merchandise drops that carry the celebration into
          physical retail.
        </p>

        <HighlightBox color="orange">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Lunchables &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; Promo:</strong> QR codes on select Lunchables packs let
              fans scan to enter for a chance to win a Nintendo Switch 2 and a digital copy of the upcoming{' '}
              <strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Super Nintendo World Sweepstakes (through May 31):</strong> Enter on the My Nintendo
              portal to win an all-expenses-paid trip for four to Super Nintendo World in{' '}
              <strong>Hollywood or Orlando</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Talking Flower Toy (March 12):</strong> Nintendo releases the interactive{' '}
              &quot;Talking Flower&quot; toy inspired by <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, featuring voice lines
              and background music from the game
            </li>
          </ul>
        </HighlightBox>

        <p>
          The Lunchables partnership is a deliberate reach into younger demographics and grocery
          retail — a distribution channel Nintendo has historically used to amplify major
          launches. Tying the Golden Ticket to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> rather than a
          Mario title is an interesting cross-franchise play, suggesting Nintendo is using MAR10
          Day as an umbrella event that extends beyond the Mario brand itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Talking Flower toy, meanwhile, is a direct merchandise extension of{' '}
          <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> — the flower design that provided sardonic commentary
          throughout that game became one of its most talked-about elements. Turning it into
          an interactive toy with in-game voice lines is a straightforward but likely effective
          piece of nostalgia merchandising.

        <h2>Why MAR10 Day 2026 Is Nintendo&apos;s Most Coordinated Marketing Campaign in Years</h2>
        <p>
          Every element of Nintendo&apos;s MAR10 Day 2026 calendar is oriented toward the same
          moment: April 1 and the theatrical debut of <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. The
          first Switch 2 sale, the Virtual Boy additions to Switch Online, the Luma update for
          Galaxy games, the sweepstakes, and the Talking Flower toy are not standalone
          promotions — they are a sequenced campaign designed to keep the Mario franchise
          at the top of the cultural conversation for the next 27 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a franchise that has defined Nintendo since 1985, the 40th anniversary timing gives
          every element of this campaign additional weight. The{' '}
          <a href="/video-games">broader gaming industry</a> will be watching how Nintendo
          threads the needle between nostalgia and forward momentum — and whether <em>Galaxy</em>{' '}
          can match the cultural footprint of its 2023 predecessor.
