        KSI is a founding member of the Sidemen and co-founder of PRIME Hydration, which generated over 
        $1.2 billion in revenue within its first two years.
      </Notice>

      <Section id="overview" title="Overview">
        <p>
          <strong>KSI</strong> (born <strong>Olajide Olayinka Williams Olatunji</strong> on June 19, 1993) is a
          British-Nigerian YouTuber, professional boxer, recording artist, and entrepreneur from Watford, England.
          He is best known as a founding member of the <Link href="/youtube/sidemen" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Sidemen</Link>,
          the UK's most successful YouTube collective, and as the co-founder of{' '}
          <strong>PRIME Hydration</strong> alongside <Link href="/youtube/logan-paul" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Logan Paul</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          KSI began his YouTube career in 2009 uploading FIFA gaming commentary videos before rapidly expanding into vlogs,
          challenges, and viral content. He has accumulated over <strong>24 million subscribers</strong> on his main channel,
          making him one of the most-subscribed British YouTubers of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond YouTube, KSI has established himself as a legitimate professional boxer with a record of{' '}
          <strong>6 wins, 0 losses, and 1 draw</strong>, a multi-platinum recording artist with collaborations
          spanning artists like Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, and Anne-Marie, and a co-founder of PRIME Hydration — a
          sports beverage brand that generated over <strong>$1.2 billion in revenue</strong> within its first two
          years on the market.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="youtube" title="YouTube Career">
        <p>
          KSI launched his YouTube channel in 2009 at the age of 15, initially uploading FIFA gaming videos and
          commentary. His energetic personality, comedic timing, and willingness to respond directly to comments
          and fan feedback helped him rapidly grow his audience during YouTube's early gaming era.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2012, KSI had diversified his content into vlogs, challenges, and reaction videos, capitalizing on
          the growing demand for personality-driven content rather than pure gameplay. His controversial and
          often self-deprecating humor consistently drove views and engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          His channel today spans gaming, music videos, boxing highlights, vlogs, and cross-content with fellow
          Sidemen members. KSI's second channel, <strong>JJ Olatunji</strong>, supplements the main channel
          with more personal, unfiltered content.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">Key Statistics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>24M+ subscribers</strong> on main channel</li>
          <li><strong>7B+ total views</strong> across all content</li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - Year channel launched</li>
          <li><strong>Over 15 years</strong> of consistent content creation</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section id="sidemen" title="Sidemen">
        <p>
          In 2013, KSI co-founded the <Link href="/youtube/sidemen" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Sidemen</Link> —
          a collective of seven British YouTubers that quickly became the UK's most-watched and commercially
          successful creator group. Alongside KSI, the founding members include Miniminter, Zerkaa, TBJZL, Behzinga,
          Vikkstar123, and W2S.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sidemen produce weekly collaborative videos, host charity football matches that routinely attract
          over 50,000 live attendees, and operate the Sides brand — including clothing, food (Sides restaurants),
          and entertainment ventures. Their combined subscriber count across all channels exceeds{' '}
          <strong>100 million subscribers</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          KSI is widely regarded as the Sidemen's breakout star, having achieved the greatest mainstream
          crossover through his boxing career, music, and business ventures. However, all seven members have
          independently built multi-million subscriber channels and separate business interests.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="boxing" title="Boxing Career">
        <p>
          KSI's boxing career began as a response to online feuds but quickly evolved into a legitimate
          athletic pursuit. His 2018 amateur fight against fellow YouTuber <strong>Joe Weller</strong> — which
          he won via TKO in the third round — generated millions of views and proved that creator boxing events
          could draw mainstream audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          This led to two monumental bouts against <Link href="/youtube/logan-paul" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Logan Paul</Link>,
          first ending in a controversial split draw at Manchester Arena in August 2018, then a rematch in November
          2019 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles — which KSI won by split decision. Both events broke pay-per-view
          records for online streaming and drew mainstream sports media coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          KSI continued his boxing career with victories over FaZe Temperrr, Swarmz, and professional boxer
          Luis Alcaraz Pineda, demonstrating a commitment to improving as a fighter rather than simply cashing
          in on celebrity matchmaking.

      <Section id="music" title="Music Career">
        <p>
          KSI's music career began as a comedic extension of his YouTube brand but evolved into a
          commercially successful and critically recognized body of work. His early tracks such as
          <strong> "Lamborghini"</strong> (featuring P Money) and subsequent singles demonstrated that
          he could produce music that resonated beyond his YouTube audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          His 2020 single <strong>"Lighter"</strong> featuring Nathan Dawe peaked at number one on
          the UK Singles Chart, making KSI the first UK YouTuber to achieve a number one record. He has since
          released multiple studio albums and collaborated with established artists including{' '}
          <strong>Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Anne-Marie, Yungblud</strong>, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          KSI has headlined sold-out UK arena tours and performed at major festivals, blurring the lines
          between internet celebrity and mainstream music artist. His music videos consistently accumulate
          hundreds of millions of views on YouTube.
        </p>

      <Section id="prime" title="PRIME Hydration">
        <p>
          In January 2022, KSI and{' '}
          <Link href="/youtube/logan-paul" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Logan Paul</Link> — former rivals
          who had fought two boxing matches — co-founded <strong>PRIME Hydration</strong>, a sports drink and
          hydration brand. The partnership between two of the internet's biggest personalities created one of
          the fastest-growing consumer beverage brands in history.
        </p>
        <p>
          PRIME generated over <strong>$1.2 billion in revenue within its first two years</strong>, a remarkable
          achievement for any consumer product, let alone one launched by content creators without traditional
          distribution infrastructure. Products routinely sold out in major retailers including Walmart, Costco, and ASDA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The brand secured headline sponsorship deals with major sports organizations, including the{' '}
          <strong>UFC</strong>, <strong>Arsenal FC</strong>, <strong>LA Dodgers</strong>, and{' '}
          <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong>, dramatically expanding brand recognition beyond the creators'
          existing audiences.

          creator boxing cards across the UK and US, capitalizing on the mainstream appetite for the format
