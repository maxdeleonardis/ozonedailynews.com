            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              ObjectWire is a precision intelligence publisher dedicated to delivering event-driven analysis 
              on business, technology, and policy developments. Our mission is to transform raw information 
              into actionable intelligence through rigorous verification and synthesis.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Accuracy</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              All content must be factually correct, thoroughly researched, and verified using primary sources. 
              Publications are event-driven and only produced when they meet our internal threshold for relevance 
              and verifiability.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Errors must be corrected promptly, with transparent updates and notations indicating what was changed and when.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Source Verification</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Every claim is traced to primary sources. We cite origins, not aggregators. All sources must be 
              documented and available for independent verification. Anonymous sources are used sparingly and 
              only when the information cannot be obtained otherwise and the source's reliability has been established.

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">All content undergoes a three-stage review:</p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-600">
              <li><strong>Drafting:</strong> Author verifies facts against primary sources</li>
              <li><strong>Internal Edit:</strong> Editor checks for clarity, relevance, and adherence to standards</li>
              <li><strong>Final Approval:</strong> Publisher confirms threshold met and authorizes publication</li>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Fairness and Objectivity</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              We present balanced, evidence-based analysis without bias or favoritism. Opinion or interpretive 
              elements must be clearly labeled and grounded in verifiable data. We seek comment from all relevant 
              parties before publication.

              When errors are identified, we correct them promptly and transparently. Corrections are noted at 
              the top of the article with a timestamp. Significant corrections that affect the substance of 
              reporting are highlighted prominently.
