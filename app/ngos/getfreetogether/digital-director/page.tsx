            As Digital Director of Get Free Together, Naftali Ehrenkranz oversees the organization's 
            digital strategy, online organizing efforts, and technology infrastructure. In modern 
            political and advocacy organizations, the Digital Director role typically encompasses 
            campaign websites, social media strategy, email communications, digital advertising, 
            and data analytics.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            For a 501(c)(4) organization like Get Free Together, the Digital Director's work exists 
            in the intersection between issue advocacy and political campaigning. The role requires 
            careful navigation of IRS regulations that permit political activity but prohibit it 
            from being the organization's primary purpose.

            While there is nothing inherently problematic about hiring digital staff or running 
            online advocacy campaigns, the limited public information about Get Free Together's 
            leadership raises questions about organizational accountability.

          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Best practices in nonprofit governance suggest that organizations should be transparent 
            about leadership qualifications, organizational structure, and programmatic priorities. 
            The sparse public information about Get Free Together's operations makes it difficult 
            to assess whether the organization fulfills its stated social welfare mission.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Industry Context</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            The Digital Director role has become increasingly important in modern advocacy 
            organizations, particularly 501(c)(4) entities that operate in the political space. 
            These positions command significant responsibility and often control substantial 
            advertising budgets during election cycles.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
            <h3 className="font-bold mb-3">Digital Campaign Spending in 501(c)(4) Organizations</h3>
            <p className="text-sm mb-4">
              Major 501(c)(4) organizations routinely spend millions on digital advertising, 
              particularly during election years. These expenditures include:
            </p>
            <ul className="text-sm space-y-1">
              <li>• Facebook and Instagram ads targeting specific demographics</li>
              <li>• Google search ads on political and policy topics</li>
              <li>• YouTube video advertising</li>
              <li>• Programmatic display advertising across news websites</li>
              <li>• Email marketing to supporter databases</li>
              <li>• Text message campaigns (peer-to-peer and mass messaging)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Because 501(c)(4) organizations don't disclose donors, it's often impossible to trace 
            the funding sources behind major digital campaigns. This opacity has led to concerns 
            about "dark money" influence in elections and policy debates.

        <section className="mb-12 pb-8 border-t-2 border-gray-300 pt-8">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Conclusion</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Naftali Ehrenkranz's role as Digital Director places him at the center of Get Free 
            Together's online operations and advocacy efforts. However, the limited public 
            information about his background, the organization's structure, and its programmatic 
            activities makes it difficult to assess whether Get Free Together operates primarily 
            as a social welfare organization or as a political campaign vehicle.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            The organization's hiring patterns—emphasizing digital organizing, field operations, 
            and rapid mobilization—are more characteristic of political campaigns than traditional 
            nonprofit service delivery. This alignment doesn't violate 501(c)(4) regulations if 
            political activity remains secondary to social welfare purposes, but it does warrant 
            scrutiny from regulators and the public.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-300 p-6 rounded-lg">

              ObjectWire's Recommendation:
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm">
              Get Free Together should publish detailed information about its leadership team, 
              including professional backgrounds and qualifications. Transparency about 
              organizational structure, program activities, and impact metrics would help 
              demonstrate that the organization genuinely serves social welfare purposes rather 
              than functioning primarily as a political operation.
