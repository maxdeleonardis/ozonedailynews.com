        <div className="prose max-w-none">
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Jens Grede</strong> (born 1974) is a Swedish entrepreneur and CEO of 
            <Link href="/clothing/skims" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline"> SKIMS</Link>, which he co-founded with 
            <Link href="/clothing/skims/creative-director" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline"> Kim Kardashian</Link> in 2019. 
            A serial entrepreneur with a track record of building successful fashion brands, Grede brought critical business expertise 
            and operational knowledge that transformed Kardashian's creative vision into a $4 billion company. His previous ventures 
            include Frame Denim and Good American, both of which reached nine-figure valuations.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">Early Career and Background</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Grede studied at Stockholm School of Economics before moving to London to work in brand consultancy and marketing. His 
            early career focused on helping fashion brands develop their market positioning and growth strategies. This foundational 
            experience taught him the mechanics of building brands from concept to scale.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In 2013, he co-founded Saturday Group with his wife Emma Grede, a brand development and marketing company focused on 
            partnering with celebrities and influencers to build fashion businesses. Saturday Group's model was innovative: combine 
            celebrity reach with professional business operations to create genuine brands, not just celebrity merch.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">Frame Denim and Good American</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Before SKIMS, Grede co-founded Frame in 2012, a premium denim brand that quickly gained traction in the competitive 
            contemporary fashion market. Frame's success came from focusing on fit, quality, and a clean aesthetic—principles he 
            would later apply to SKIMS. The brand was acquired by Sequential Brands Group (later Bluestar Alliance) but continues 
            to operate and grow.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In 2016, Grede partnered with Khloé Kardashian to launch Good American, a denim brand emphasizing size inclusivity and 
            body positivity. Good American generated $1 million in sales on its first day, a record for a denim brand launch. This 
            partnership with the Kardashian family gave Grede insight into their business acumen and market influence, setting the 
            stage for the SKIMS collaboration.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">Partnership with Kim Kardashian</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Grede first connected with Kim Kardashian through his work with Good American and the broader Kardashian family business 
            network. When Kardashian expressed interest in launching a shapewear line in 2018, Grede was the natural choice for a 
            business partner. He had already proven he could build brands with celebrity founders while maintaining operational 
            excellence and profitability.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Their partnership works because of clearly defined roles: Kardashian handles creative direction, product design, and 
            marketing strategy, while Grede manages business operations, financial planning, supply chain, fundraising, and growth 
            strategy. "Kim is the ultimate creative force, and I focus on building the business infrastructure to support her vision," 
            Grede has said in interviews.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This division of labor has been crucial to SKIMS' success. While Kardashian's social media presence and creative instincts 
            drive brand awareness and product development, Grede ensures the company has the operational backbone to scale efficiently 
            and profitably.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">Business Strategy at SKIMS</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            As CEO, Grede implemented a direct-to-consumer model that gives SKIMS control over customer relationships, pricing, and 
            brand experience. This approach maximizes margins and allows rapid iteration based on customer feedback—a key advantage 
            in the fast-moving fashion industry.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Grede's "drop" strategy creates urgency and exclusivity. New collections launch with limited inventory, selling out quickly 
            and generating social media buzz. This model reduces inventory risk while maintaining strong demand. It's a strategy he 
            perfected at Frame and refined at SKIMS.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Under his leadership, SKIMS raised $240 million in Series A funding in 2022, achieving a $3.2 billion valuation. Just 
            one year later, additional funding pushed the valuation to $4 billion. Grede's ability to attract institutional investors 
            like Lone Pine Capital demonstrated that SKIMS was more than a celebrity brand—it was a serious business with sustainable 
            economics.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">Expansion and Diversification</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Grede orchestrated SKIMS' expansion beyond shapewear into loungewear, swimwear, and menswear. Each category launch was 
            carefully timed and supported by robust supply chain planning. The decision to enter menswear in 2023 was particularly 
            strategic, opening an entirely new customer segment.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The landmark partnership with the NBA, WNBA, and USA Basketball in 2023 was a Grede-led initiative. Positioning SKIMS 
            as athletic underwear required convincing sports organizations that the brand could deliver performance-level products. 
            This partnership elevated SKIMS from lifestyle brand to mainstream athletic apparel competitor.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Grede also spearheaded SKIMS' move into physical retail with flagship stores in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami. While 
            maintaining the DTC model online, these stores serve as brand experiences and customer acquisition channels, reaching 
            shoppers who prefer in-person shopping.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">Operational Excellence</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            One of Grede's core strengths is supply chain management. SKIMS maintains high product quality while scaling rapidly—a 
            notoriously difficult balance in fashion. Grede built relationships with manufacturers who could meet SKIMS' standards 
            for fabric quality, construction, and ethical production.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            He implemented sophisticated inventory management systems that balance the "drop" model's limited releases with the need 
            to avoid stockouts on core products. SKIMS restocks popular items regularly while maintaining the excitement around new 
            product launches.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">Leadership Philosophy</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Grede's leadership style emphasizes building strong teams and empowering them to execute. He's hired experienced executives 
            from established fashion and retail companies, bringing institutional knowledge to complement the brand's startup energy.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            He's known for data-driven decision making, using customer analytics and sales data to inform everything from product 
            development to marketing spend. This analytical approach balances Kardashian's creative intuition, resulting in products 
            that are both innovative and commercially successful.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Colleagues describe him as collaborative and focused on long-term sustainability rather than short-term hype. While SKIMS 
            benefits from celebrity-driven attention, Grede ensures the business fundamentals—margin structure, customer retention, 
            operational efficiency—remain strong.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">Industry Impact</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Grede has become a respected figure in the fashion entrepreneurship space, frequently speaking at industry conferences 
            about building celebrity brands with substance. His success with Frame, Good American, and SKIMS has established him as 
            an expert in the direct-to-consumer fashion model.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Business publications including Forbes, Bloomberg, and The Wall Street Journal have profiled Grede, recognizing his role 
            in transforming how celebrity fashion brands are built and scaled. His model—combining celebrity creative direction with 
            professional management—has been copied by numerous other celebrity entrepreneurs.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 border-b pb-2">Future Vision</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Grede has indicated plans to continue expanding SKIMS internationally and into new product categories. He's mentioned 
            potential for beauty products, accessories, and further athletic wear, though he emphasizes careful category selection 
            that aligns with the brand's core identity.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            His long-term goal is to build SKIMS into a multi-generational brand that transcends its celebrity founder origins. 
            While Kardashian's involvement remains crucial, Grede is building institutional structures that will allow the brand to 
            endure and grow for decades.
